# <span class="gradient">Hi, I'm Mike</span> ðŸ‘‹

<p class="leadin">Senior developer / product owner</p>

I've worked as a MERN (Mongo, Express, React, Node)
developer for more than 10 years. For small business and
Fortune 500, I've managed the design, development and
deployment of countless custom applications that have made
measurable differences to those companies. I specialize in
headless architecture, focusing on performance,
accessibility and usability.
