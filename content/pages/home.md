<p class="leadin">Technical Lead / Senior developer</p>

I've worked as a full stack web developer for more than 10
years. From small business to Fortune 500, I've managed the
design, development and deployment of countless custom
applications that have made measurable differences to those
companies. I specialize in headless architecture, focusing
on performance, accessibility and usability.
