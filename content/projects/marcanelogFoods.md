Marcangelo was a fun project to flex my design muscles.
Unlike some other websites I've built, though, this one had
some regulation and accessibility constraints. For example,
the online nutritional tables needed to pass rigoruous
formatting checks, which differed between products in Canada
and the US. Likewise, redirecting traffic to the correct
top-level domain and product catalogue based on their
location brought about some challenges.

Although not overly complex, it's a notable client and piece
that I like to keep in my portfolio for inspiration.
