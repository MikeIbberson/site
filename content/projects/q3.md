As both a technical lead and business partner, I realized
early with 3merge that we needed a system to standardize our
practice and reduce upfront development costs. I also
recognized our clients shared needs, so building portable
components and modules allowed me to deliver value faster on
their projects.

Five years later, Q3's in its 4th major version and comes
packed with features (e.g. authorization, file management,
email templating, locale editing, etc)! It takes care of the
grunt work developers face with large systems and allows
them to focus on their projects' unique business drivers.
