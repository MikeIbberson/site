As both the technical lead and a business partner, I
realized early with 3merge that we needed a system to
standardize how we build products and reduce upfront
development costs. I also recognized our clients shared
needs, so the value of a system that could allow them to
share components, collaborate with and benefit from one
another was appealing.

Five years later, Q3's in its 4th major version and comes
packed with features! From authorization to file management
to email templating to locale editing, it handles most of
the grunt work developers face with large systems and allows
them to focus just on the unique business drivers of the
project.
